# Kato

Empowering Your Productivity Journey, One Step at a Time!

## Overview

Kato is a free and evolving alternative to the Momentum app. Kato is a productivity and habit-tracking application designed to help users stay focused, set goals, and manage their time effectively. Please note that Kato is still a work in progress, but it aims to provide a comparable experience to existing productivity apps.

Kato replaces the default new tab page with a visually pleasing dashboard. It offers a clean and intuitive design, featuring a daily inspirational quote, a to-do list, and a weather widget.

While Kato is under development, it focuses on providing a goal-setting and habit-tracking system. Users can set daily or weekly goals, monitor their progress, and receive reminders to stay on track. Additionally, Kato intends to incorporate a "Focus" mode in the future to create an optimal work environment.

As a work in progress, it strives to continually improve and refine its features based on user feedback and evolving needs. Stay tuned for updates as Kato evolves into a robust productivity tool.
